# Predicting-Housing-Prices

The project revolves around developing a robust predictive model for estimating housing prices leveraging a Linear Regression algorithm. Utilizing the extensively rich California Housing dataset, this endeavor involves an in-depth exploration of diverse factors influencing housing prices. These encompass crucial features including housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, and ocean proximity.

Through rigorous data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model training, the project aspires to furnish comprehensive insights into the relationships between these variables and the median house values. The predictive model aims to accurately forecast housing prices, thereby empowering stakeholders with actionable and data-driven insights for real estate decision-making.

The visualization aspects delve into presenting a clear visual representation of the model's predictive capabilities. This encompasses scatter plots to exhibit actual versus predicted housing values, histograms depicting the distribution of median house values, and detailed histograms illustrating the distribution of numerical features. This multi-dimensional approach not only facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the predictive model but also offers a nuanced perspective on the housing market dynamics in California."
